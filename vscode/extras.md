# E. Additional extensions

## Nice extensions for coding

### [Partial Diff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryu1kn.partial-diff)

File comparison tool. Invaluable!

### [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)

![Screenshot of Error Lens extension](error_lens.png)

Displays errors inline with the source code.
However, error hints do not move with the source code during editing, so using this extension is a matter of taste.

### [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)

![Todo Tree screenshot](todotree.png)

This extension collects the `TODO: xxx` comments through the project and displays them in a tree.

### [tldraw](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tldraw-org.tldraw-vscode)

![tldraw screenshot](tldraw.png)

Excellent drawing tool, if your computer is equipped with a touchscreen.

I wasn't able to get pressure sensitivity working on Linux using a Huion tablet; and the [PNG export feature is missing](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/605) as of March 2022.

### [Project Dashboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kruemelkatze.vscode-dashboard)

Replaces the VS Code by a list of user-selectable projects.

## For scientists

### [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)

![LaTeX Workshop screenshot](latex.png)
Complete LaTeX editing environment. 
Builds PDFs on the fly.
Has bidirectional PDF<->LaTeX synchronization.
Math preview on mouse hover.

**Warning:** Includes its own PDF viewer, which conflicts with other PDF viewer extensions, so uninstall those if you installed them.


## Data science

### [HDF5 Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lochbrunner.vscode-hdf5-viewer)

This extension explores the structure of HDF5 files, but is pretty limited when it comes to data visualization.
