# Modern tools for scientific Python programming

This contains the content for a series of three tutorials. Those tutorials were originally held
at the Geneva Observatory in Spring 2022. They use packages and techniques that are stable and
state-of-the-art at that period.

While the tutorials have been designed for an audience of astrophysicists, they should be relevant
for researchers in various areas of physics. Our aim is to introduce tools and techniques that
satisfy the criteria below:

- the tools integrate well with existing coding practices and they can be adopted incrementally

- the information about the code is in a single place, in the code itself, and is amenable to
  automated checks

- the tools and techniques apply to code at various stages of maturity (scripts, prototypes, 
  as well as mature published packages)
